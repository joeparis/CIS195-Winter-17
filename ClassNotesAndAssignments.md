# Class Notes and Assignments

## March 7, 2017

Create a copy of your Miss Baker site and re-vamp it so that it works well across devices of any size. Use the principles of responsive design we discussed in class. At the very least you must do something to change the layout involving the <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> but look for other elements that you may want to address in some responsive manner. We will talk a bit more about responsive images in our next class but if you like feel free to tackle the image now.

Due March 9.

## February 23, 2017

For next class complete <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/adding-media/">Lesson 9: Adding Media</a>, <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/building-forms/">Lesson 10: Building Forms</a> and <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/organizing-data-with-tables/">Lesson 11: Organizing Data with Tables</a>. Bring any questions you have to class.

## February 9, 2017

For next class read and complete <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/setting-backgrounds-and-gradients/">Lesson 7: Setting Backgrounds &amp; Gradients</a> and <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/creating-lists/">Lesson 8: Creating Lists</a>. Bring any questions you have to class. Also, create a second copy of your Miss Baker site and add a gradient of your own choosing to its background (either the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> or the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element, your choice). Make sure your content is still legible with the new background. Also, add some color to the page that works well with your background. You may want to use the <a href="http://colorschemedesigner.com/csd-3.5/">Color Scheme Designer</a> to aid you with this. Be sure to apply all necessary vendor prefixes to your CSS.

Download the `miss_baker.zip` file and begin marking it up with structural elements. Layout the basic structure of the page in a way that makes sense to you. Use CSS to format the page attractively but try to avoid adding IDs and classes unless absolutely necessary; rather, try to write selectors that depend primarily on the tags you've chosen and their descendants for this part of the assignment. The idea here is to build the scaffolding that supports the page's content. We will be re-visiting this assignment to modify it further soon.

I'm going to speed things up a bit in class. Rather than try to lecture and cover every aspect of what you need I'll be assigning some readings for each class going forward. For this coming Tuesday read <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/opening-the-box-model/">Lesson 4: Opening the Box Model</a>, <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/positioning-content/">Lesson 5: Positioning Content</a>, and <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/working-with-typography/">Lesson 6: Working with Typography</a>. For more on the clearfix hack see <a href="http://cssmojo.com/the-very-latest-clearfix-reloaded/">The very latest clearfix reloaded</a>. For another (better) way of positioning elements see <a href="http://webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/master-css-flexbox-5-simple-steps">Master CSS Flexbox in 5 Simple Steps</a> and <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.com/an-animated-guide-to-flexbox-d280cf6afc35#.nxl27pepc">How Flexbox works — explained with big, colorful, animated gifs</a>.

Upload your Miss Baker page to the class web server being sure to link to it from your homepage as "Miss Baker - Take 1." Also, complete the **In Practice** sections of "Opening the Box Model," "Positioning Content," and "Working with Typography." For each of these create a new copy of the Styles Conference web site in a separate folder and link to it from your homepage using links with the text "Opening the Box Model," "Positioning Content," and "Working with Typography" respectively. I will need to be able to see each iteration of the site independently.
 

## January 12, 2017 - Part 2

For next class create a web page about yourself. You page should reflect good structure (choose tags meaningfully being sure they represent the purpose of the content). Think of heading tags as creating the basic structure that you hang the rest of your page off of. Use at least two tags that we haven't yet discussed in class. For each tag in the `<body>` of your document include a comment explaining why you thought it was the most appropriate to use at that time.

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  
</body>
</html>
```
