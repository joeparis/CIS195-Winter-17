## Course Description

This course introduces web page development using standard-compliant, accessible techniques and technologies through an examination of HTML5, CSS and relevant computer graphic file formats. Students will use various software packages including multiple web browsers, text editors, graphic software, and FTP software. An emphasis will be placed on learning to write HTML5 and CSS script without the help of advanced web design software.

## Course Objectives

Upon completion of the course you will be able to:

1. Write standards compliant and browser-agnostic HTML and CSS by hand
1. Select the appropriate tag to use for a given purpose.
1. Describe the differences between available media formats for use on the web.
1. Describe the HTML DOM.
1. Use the tools built in to the browser to examine and explore the DOM.
1. Employ the latest CSS technologies to format and lay out DOM elements.

## Required Course materials

Internet access, required, available in limited fashion in various college computer labs or through your local Internet service provider (ISP).

Various free software applications will be discussed in class, many of which will be pre-installed on the computers in the Library Computer Lab.

## Class Policies

You will get the most from this class if you attend every day. Much of the material covered won't come directly from the book. A lot of your learning will involve class discussion which can only happen if you are present. Additionally, assignments, quiz or exam dates, and other important information may be announced in class.

You are expected to be prepared for each class, having completed all reading and homework assignments.  The course is extremely cumulative so a good start is essential.

This class will strongly emphasize *peer instruction* in which all students in the class will cooperatively and collaboratively learn the material. Again, you must be present in class and have read the assigned materials in order for this to be possible.

While in class, please set your cell phone to *vibrate*. If you need to take a call, please step out of the room to do so.

## Assignments

Assignments may include completing designated readings, individual homework problems, lab activities, and individual or group projects. 

It is recommended that you use the computers in the labs in McKenzie Hall (MKH-105, MKH-103) or the Library Computer Lab. You are responsible for checking the lab schedule for its hours.

Alternately, you may use your own personal computers provided it has any required software installed.

Assignments are due at the beginning of class on the due date unless otherwise specified. Late assignments will not be accepted, no exceptions. 

Assignments may not be submitted via e-mail.

Written assignments must be word processed and spell- and grammar-checked.

You should expect a combination of in-class and out-of-class assignments. Some of these may be group while others are individual.

Instructions for submitting assignments will be given in class.

## Project

There will be a final project given for the course.

## Independent Work

As students, you are encouraged to discuss assignments and course materials with your peers. However, unless the assignment is a group project, the work you turn in to be graded must be yours and yours alone and you must be capable of explaining it verbally to the instructor if asked. If you received pointers or guidance from another student in the class you must clearly state that near the top of the assignment and list the names of everyone who helped. Written work that appears to be directly copied from another student will not be given credit.

## Tutors

Tutors are generally available for this and other computer science classes.  Check with the instructor and/or the Learning Center if you feel you need further assistance with this course.

## Incompletes

If you have satisfactorily completed most of the course work and have then encountered an emergency which, in the instructor's judgment, is sufficiently serious to warrant it, the instructor will prepare an Incomplete Agreement specifying the work that you will need to complete by the end of the following term in order to earn the credit for the class. The Agreement will specify a default grade based on the work which you have completed to date. In the case you do not fulfill the agreement the default grade will automatically be assigned at the end of the following term.

## Student Rights & Responsibilities

All students are expected to be familiar with the Student Rights and Responsibilities handbook, and to follow the conduct guidelines outlined. The handbook can be found on the LBCC Website, under Students/Students Rights.

## LBCC Center for Accessibility Resources

Students who may need accommodations due to documented disabilities, or who have medical information which the instructor should know, or who need special arrangements in an emergency, should speak with the instructor during the first week of class. If you believe you may need accommodation services, please contact the Center for Accessibility Resources, 541-917-4789. If you have documented your disability, remember that you must make your request for accommodations through the [Center for Accessibility Resources web page](https://www.linnbenton.edu/cfar) every term in order to receive accommodations.
